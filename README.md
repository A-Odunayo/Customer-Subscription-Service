# Customer Segmentation Analysis for Subscription Service

## Project Overview

This project analyzes customer data from a subscription service to identify customer segments, trends in cancellations and renewals, and patterns in subscription types. The analysis results in a Power BI dashboard that provides actionable insights for stakeholders, enabling data-driven decisions to enhance customer retention and revenue growth.

## Project Goals

1. **Identify Key Customer Segments**: Uncover patterns in subscription types and durations.
2. **Analyze Cancellations and Renewals**: Discover trends and possible drivers behind cancellations and renewals.
3. **Create Interactive Visuals**: Use Power BI to build a dashboard with interactive data filtering for in-depth analysis.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Excel**: Data summarization and pivot table analysis.
- **SQL**: Data extraction and analysis to answer key business questions.
- **Power BI**: Visualization and dashboard creation for stakeholder review.

## Data Source

The data for this project includes customer records from a subscription service database. Each record contains details on subscription type, duration, customer region, start and end dates, cancellation status, and revenue information.

> **Note**: The dataset used in this project is either synthetic or anonymized for privacy. If real data were to be used, privacy considerations such as data masking and anonymization would apply to protect sensitive information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA was conducted to understand the distribution and relationships within the data before performing detailed analysis. Key steps included:

- **Data Cleaning**: Checked for missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Generated summary statistics for subscription durations, cancellations, and revenue distribution.
- **Visualization**: Created basic charts to visualize customer distribution by region, subscription type popularity, and overall revenue contributions.

The `excel/` folder contains an `EDA_summary.xlsx` file with detailed EDA insights, pivot tables, and initial visualizations.

## Analysis

The main analysis is organized into Excel, SQL, and Power BI tasks to achieve each project goal. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

### 1. Excel Analysis

**Objective**: Use pivot tables to identify patterns in subscription types and durations.

#### Steps:
- Calculate the average subscription duration.
- Identify the most popular subscription types.
- Generate additional reports to reveal trends in the dataset.

### 2. SQL Analysis

**Objective**: Extract key insights using SQL queries.

#### Steps:
- **Customer Distribution by Region**: Calculate the total number of customers from each region.
- **Subscription Popularity**: Identify popular subscription types.
- **Customer Cancellations**: Retrieve customers who canceled within six months.
- **Average Subscription Duration**: Calculate the average duration of subscriptions.
- **Long-Term Subscribers**: Find customers with subscriptions longer than 12 months.
- **Revenue Calculation**: Calculate total revenue by subscription type.
- **Regional Cancellations**: Identify the top three regions by cancellation rate.
- **Subscription Status**: Count active and canceled subscriptions.

### 3. Power BI Dashboard

**Objective**: Visualize customer segments, cancellation rates, and subscription trends.

#### Dashboard Visualizations:
- **Subscription Types by Popularity**: Bar chart showing the popularity of subscription types.
- **Cancellations by Region**: Heat map or column chart displaying regional cancellations.
- **Subscription Duration Distribution**: Histogram of average subscription durations.
- **Revenue by Subscription Type**: Pie or donut chart illustrating revenue by subscription type.
- **Active vs. Canceled Subscriptions**: Stacked bar chart comparing active and canceled subscriptions.
- **Top Regions by Cancellations**: Ranking chart of the top three regions with the highest cancellation rates.
- **Interactive Slicers**: Filters for region, subscription type, and status to allow stakeholders to explore the data.

## Findings

From the data analysis and dashboard insights:

- **Popular Subscription Types**: Short-term plans are most common, indicating that customers may be hesitant to commit to long-term plans.
- **High Cancellation Rate in Specific Regions**: Certain regions have higher cancellation rates, especially within the first six months.
- **Revenue Distribution**: A few subscription types contribute most to the revenue, suggesting potential for pricing strategy adjustments.
- **Long-Term Subscribers**: A smaller segment maintains subscriptions beyond 12 months, indicating possible brand loyalty within this group.

## Recommendations

Based on the findings, here are targeted recommendations to improve customer retention and revenue:

- **Targeted Retention Efforts**: Implement customer retention strategies in high-cancellation regions, possibly using personalized offers or incentives.
- **Expand Popular Subscription Types**: Introduce variations of popular plans to cater to a wider audience and potentially increase revenue.
- **Loyalty Programs**: Develop programs for customers with subscriptions over 12 months to encourage long-term engagement.
- **Market Analysis for High-Cancellation Segments**: Conduct further analysis to address high cancellation rates and improve customer satisfaction.
